Choi and Donghun Kang.\r\nThis project contains the source codes of exemplary DES simulators presented at the book MSDES.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and run on your local machine for development purposes. \r\nSee the guiding document for each DES simulator kept in the \"guide\" folder. \r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nAll DES simulators are developed in C# using Visual Studio 2015. \r\nIf this is your first time, please download Visual Studio 2015 Community Version from [Visual Studio website](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).\r\n\r\n",
