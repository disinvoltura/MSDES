# MSDES
MSDES stands for Modeling and Simulation of Discrete-Event Systems, a book written by Byoung K. Choi and Donghun Kang.
This project contains the source codes of exemplary DES simulators presented at the book MSDES.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes. 
See the guide document for each DES simulator kept in the "guide" folder. 

### Prerequisities
All DES simulators are developed in C# using Visual Stuio 2015. 
If this is your first time, please download Visual Studio 2015 Community Version from [Visual Studio website](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx).
